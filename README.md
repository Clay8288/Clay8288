# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ :v:

Welcome on my Github page.

## About me...

My name is Clelia, I'm a junior developper back-end.

After nearly 10 years in business travel, I decided to come back to my first love...the code...
I first started by self-learning thanks to [Grafikart](https://grafikart.fr/) and [Javascript de zÃ©ro](https://www.javascriptdezero.com/), then I decided to undertake a training with the [O'clock school](https://oclock.io/) which allowed me to discover my affinity for the back-end.

I am particularly interested in good development practices and wish to continue to train with experienced developers who are willing to share their knowledge. 
That's why, I decided to join the [What The Fabrik](https://www.whatthefabrik.fr/) Discord where I am a moderator. 
All experiences are welcome, whether it's with an apprenticeship or a job.
